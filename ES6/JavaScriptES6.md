# VAR, LET, CONST

### 1-VAR

- can be reassigned and update 
- these variables are function scoped which means that they are only available to inside the function they  created
- if `var` is not created in function then it is global. 

### 2-Let , CONST

- let , const are blocked scoped

- you cannot re-declare let and const in same scope more then once 

- `let` variables can be updated 

- `const`variables cannot be updated

  `let` `const` are use full in function like `iife`

with `iife` you create a function for block purpose so that variable don't become global accidentally.
